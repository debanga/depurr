# A Brief overview on Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

This article discusses PCA and related algorithms with example codes. In particular, we will go over the following algorithms:
1. Principle Component Analysis
2. Linear Discriminent Analysis
3. Singular Value Decomposition

Although you may have heard about these algorithms at different point of time presented in different flavors, fundamentally they are very similar. Studying them under one single 
lens will provide a global understanding, and therefore, making it easier to remember these concepts.
