# A Brief overview of Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

In this article, we discuss PCA and its related algorithms with example codes. In particular, we will include the following algorithms:
1. Principal Component Analysis
2. Linear Discriminent Analysis
3. Singular Value Decomposition

You may have seen these algorithms in different articles or books presented as separate concepts, but fundamentally they have many similarities. Studying them under one single lens of dimensionality reduction will provide us with a global understanding, and therefore, it will make it easier to remember these concepts.
